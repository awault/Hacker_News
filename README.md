This is a project I completed as part of the Data Analyst curriculum from Dataquest. The projects are intended to reinforce concepts covered in the interactive online lessons.

The primary skills required for this project include:

- Importing data with CSV module
- Writing for loops to extract data from a list of lists
- Using strings to filter a dataset
- Working with dates and times within the datetime module
- Using functions to write code efficiently
- Using dictionaries to create frequency tables

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions.

Thank you,

AA
